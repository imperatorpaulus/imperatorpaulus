## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2nd-year student majoring in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Philosophy. My interests include:

- Computational Topology: Exploring the intersections of geometry, algorithms, and data analysis.
- Philosophy of Mathematics: Investigating the foundational questions and implications of mathematical concepts.
- Aristotle: Delving into Aristotelian logic, metaphysics, and his contributions to philosophy.
